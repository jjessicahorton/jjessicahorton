## Hi!

My name's Jess. :)

Currently, I'm...
- a Physics major at Appalachian State Univeristy
- Working in [Dr. Andrew Bellemer's](https://biology.appstate.edu/directory/dr-andrew-bellemer) Neuroscience lab
- A Medical Office Assistant at UNC Health's [AppInternal Medicine](https://www.unchealthappalachian.org/locations/profile/appinternal-medicine/)
- A prospective Data Scientist in the making!

Right now, I am currently working on my first big Data Science project underneath the hardowrking scientists who have created and maintain [FlyWire](https://flywire.ai/). I am very excited about it, and I'm looking forward to sharing my work here soon!

Thanks so much for checking out my page. I'm glad you're here!
